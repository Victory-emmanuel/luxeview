# âœ… Property Management System - Issues Fixed!

## ðŸ”§ **Issues Resolved:**

### 1. **React Select Component Error**
- **Problem**: SelectItem components were causing React rendering errors
- **Solution**: 
  - Created a separate `PropertyFilters` component with better error handling
  - Added proper type checking and error boundaries
  - Fixed value prop handling with proper defaults ("all" instead of empty string)
  - Wrapped filter components in ErrorBoundary for graceful error handling

### 2. **Firebase Storage Dependency Removed**
- **Problem**: Code was trying to use paid Firebase Storage features
- **Solution**: 
  - Completely removed all Firebase Storage imports and functions
  - Updated property service to work with image URLs only
  - Simplified image handling throughout the application

### 3. **Mock Data Interference**
- **Problem**: Mock data was interfering with real Firebase testing
- **Solution**: 
  - Removed all mock data imports and usage
  - Added proper empty state displays
  - Now ready for real property data testing

### 4. **Authentication and Loading States**
- **Problem**: Component was rendering before authentication was complete
- **Solution**: 
  - Added proper loading state checks
  - Improved error handling for unauthenticated users
  - Better user feedback during loading

## ðŸš€ **What's Now Working:**
